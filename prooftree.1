.SH NAME
prooftree \- visualize proof trees for ProofGeneral
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B prooftree [-geometry \fIspec\fB] [\fB-tee \fIfile\fB] [-debug]
.P
.B prooftree -help
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" ============= paragraph general purpose ===================================
.B Prooftree
visualizes proof trees during proof development with Proof
General. Currently it only works for \fBCoq\fR, though adding
support for other proof assistants should be relatively easy.
.\" ==========================================================================
.P
To start a proof-tree display, hit the 
.B Prooftree
icon in the 
.B ProofGeneral
tool-bar or select the menu entry
.I Proof-General
-> 
.I Start/Stop Prooftree
or type
.I C-c C-d
(which runs
.I proof-tree-external-display-toggle\fR).
Inside a proof, this will immediately start a proof-tree display
for the current proof. Outside a proof, 
.B ProofGeneral
remembers to start the proof-tree display for the next proof.
.\" ==========================================================================
.P
Under normal circumstances
.B Prooftree
is started by 
.B ProofGeneral
as an
.B Emacs
subprocess. The user interacts with 
.B Prooftree
only through the graphical user interface. A substantial part of
the proof-tree visualization task is done by
.B ProofGeneral\fR.
Therefore not only the 
.B Prooftree
command line arguments but also other aspects can only be
configured inside 
.B ProofGeneral\fR,
see 
.B ProofGeneral Customization
below.

.SH OPTIONS
.\" ==========================================================================
.IP "-geometry \fIspec\fR"
Sets the X geometry of the main window.
.I spec
is a standard X geometry string in the form 
\fIxpos\fRx\fIypos\fR[+\fIxoff\fR[+\fIyoff\fR]].
.\" ======================================= -tee =============================
.IP "-tee \fIfile\fR"
Write all input to
.I file
(usually for debugging purposes).
.\" ======================================= -debug ===========================
.IP "-debug"
Provide more details on errors.
.\" ======================================= -help ============================
.IP "-help"
Print synopsis and exit.

.SH MAIN PROOF DISPLAY
.B Prooftree
opens one window for each proof that it is requested to display.
Below the proof-tree graph this window contains a display for
sequents and proof commands. 
.\" ==========================================================================
.SS Colors
The branches in the proof-tree graph are colored
according to their state. 
.B Prooftree
distinguishes between proved branches without non-instantiated
existential variables (green by default), proved branches with
some non-instantiated existential variables (cyan by default),
the branch to the current goal (blue by default), branches
finished with a cheating command such as
.I admit
(red by default) and the currently open branches (in the default
foreground color). The colors as well as many other
.B Prooftree
parameters can be changed in the 
.B Prooftree Configuration Dialog
(see below). 
.\" ==========================================================================
.SS Navigation
When the proof tree grows large one can navigate by a variety of
means. In addition to scroll bars and the usual keys one can move
the proof tree by dragging with mouse button 1 pressed. By
default, dragging moves the viewport (i.e., the proof tree
underneath moves in the opposite direction). After setting a
negative value for 
.I Drag acceleration 
in the 
.B Prooftree Configuration Dialog\fR,
dragging will move the proof tree instead (i.e, the proof tree
moves in the same direction as the mouse).
.\" ==========================================================================
.SS Sequent Display
The sequent display below the proof tree normally shows the
ancestor sequent of the current goal. With a single left mouse
click one can display any goal or proof command in the sequent
display. A single click outside the proof tree will switch back
to default behavior. The initial size of the sequent display can
be set in the
.B Prooftree Configuration Dialog\fR.
A value of 0 hides the sequent display.
.\" ==========================================================================
.SS Tool Tips
Abbreviated proof commands and sequents are shown in full as
tool tips when the mouse pointer rests over them. Both, the tool
tips for abbreviated proof commands and for sequents can be
independently switched off in the
.B Prooftree Configuration Dialog\fR.
The length at which proof commands are abbreviated can be
configured as well.
.\" ==========================================================================
.SS Additional Displays
A double click or a shift-click displays any goal or proof
command in an additional window. These additional windows are
deleted when the main proof-tree window disappears, unless their
.I Sticky 
button is pressed.
.\" ==========================================================================
.SS Existential Variables
.B Prooftree
keeps track of existential variables and whether they have
already been instantiated. It uses different colors to display
branches with and without non-instantiated existential variables.
The list of currently not (yet) instantiated existential
variables is appended to proof commands and sequents in tool-tips
and the other displays.
.\" ==========================================================================
.P
The
.B Existential Variable Dialog
displays a table with all existential variables that currently
appear in the proof. Each line of the table contains a button
that marks the proof command that introduced this variable (with
yellow background, by default) and, if present, the proof command
that instantiated this variable (with orange background, by
default). Dependencies between different existential variables
(i.e., 
.I X
appears in the instantiation of 
.I Y\fR)
cannot be displayed.
.\" ==========================================================================
.SS Main Menu
A right-click or the 
.I Menu
button displays the main menu. The 
.I Clone
item clones the current proof tree in an additional window. This
additional window continues to display a snapshot of the cloned
proof tree, no matter what happens with the original proof.
.\" ==========================================================================
.P
The 
.I Show current
item moves the viewport to the proof tree such that the current
proof goal (if there is any) will be visible.
.\" ==========================================================================
.P
The
.I Exit
item terminates 
.B Prooftree
and closes all proof-tree displays.
.\" ==========================================================================
.P
The remaining three items display, respectively, the
.B Prooftree Configuration Dialog\fR,
and the 
.B Help
and 
.B About
windows.

.SH CONFIGURATION
.SS Prooftree Configuration Dialog
Changes in the configuration dialog take only effect when
the 
.I Apply
or
.I OK 
button is pressed. The 
.I Save 
button stores the current configuration (as marshaled 
.B Ocaml
record) in 
.I ~/.prooftree\fR,
which will overwrite the built-in default configuration for the
following 
.B Prooftree
runs. The 
.I Restore
button loads and applies the saved configuration.
.\" ==========================================================================
.SS ProofGeneral Customization
The location of the 
.B Prooftree
executable and the command line arguments are in the
customization group
.I proof-tree\fR.
Prover specific points, such as the regular expressions for
navigation and cheating commands are in the customization group
.I proof-tree-internals\fR.
To visit a customization group, type 
.I M-x customize-group
followed by the name of the customization group inside 
.B ProofGeneral\fR.

cvs repository) together with a patched version of 
.B Coq
(including the ID patch).
