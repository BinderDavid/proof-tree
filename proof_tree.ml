    read from standard input. It keeps a state record (of type
    {!proof_tree}) for all proof trees currently displayed.

(** Internal exception for state mismatches. This exception is raised
    when the internal state of one proof tree in this module is
    inconsistent with the proof-tree display command that has been
    read. In a correct setup (with the right Proof General version)
    such an error indicates a bug in either prooftree or in the Proof
    General preprocessing code. This exception can also be raised if
    prooftree is used with a wrong version of Proof General or if
    somebody manipulates the internal data structures of Proof
