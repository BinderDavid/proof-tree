           prooftree --- proof tree display for Proof General
============================================================================


Prooftree is a program for proof tree visualization during interactive
proof development in a theorem prover. It is currently being developed for
Coq and Proof General. See http://askra.de/software/prooftree/ for more
information.

Prooftree requires the (cvs) development version of Proof General
and Coq version >= 8.4beta. These versions of Proof General and Coq must be
installed separately. A binary package for Debian Squeeze i386 is available
on the Prooftree website.


============================================================================
  PREREQUISITES
============================================================================

Make sure you have a recent (cvs) development version of Proof General and
Coq 8.4beta or greater. For installation instructions see
http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/devel and http://coq.inria.fr/coq-84

If you want to install Prooftree from sources you need ocaml with the Gtk
bindings from the LablGtk2 library installed. The configure script checks
if

    ocamlopt.opt -I +lablgtk2 lablgtk.cmxa gtkInit.cmx

runs without errors. For Debian, installing the packages ocaml-nox and
liblablgtk2-ocaml-dev suffice (but the package ocaml-native-compilers is
strongly recommended for binary compilation).


============================================================================
  INSTALLATION
============================================================================

1. Configure with

   ./configure

   optionally supply -prefix <dir> or -bindir <dir> to set the installation
   directories. 

2. Compile with

   make all

3. Acquire the necessary rights and install with

   make install


============================================================================
  EMACS CONFIGURATION
============================================================================

Before you can enjoy prooftree you have to configure Emacs to find
prooftree and use the right versions of Proof General and Coq. Of course
you have to disable any other setting that select a particular Proof
General or Coq version.

1. Prooftree is controlled by Proof General as a subprocess of Emacs. You
   therefore have to make sure Emacs loads the right version of Proof
   General (from the ProofTreeBranch). Put

   (load-file "<pg-dir>/generic/proof-site.el")

   in your .emacs, where <pg-dir> is the installation directory of the
   ProofTreeBranch version of Proof General.

============================================================================
  USAGE
============================================================================

Start Emacs and load any Coq file. Proof display with prooftree is
initially disabled. To enable it, hit the prooftree tool-bar icon, select
menu Proof-General -> Start/Stop Prooftree or type C-c C-d. If you are
inside a proof any of these actions will launch a proof-tree display for
the current proof. Otherwise prooftree will be launched as soon as you
start the next proof. Comprehensive usage information is provided by the
help menu item inside Prooftree and by the Prooftree man page.


============================================================================
CREDITS / CONTACT / COPYRIGHT
============================================================================

Prooftree is more or less a reimplementation of the graphical proof display
of Pvs. The Pvs version is implemented in Tcl/Tk and controlled directly by
the Pvs prover process, which has some advantages over the prooftree
approach.
