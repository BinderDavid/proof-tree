(** {2 Communition Protocol with Proof General}

    The communication protocol with Proof General is one-way: Only
    Proof General sends commands to prooftree. In response to the 
    commands [prooftree] changes its display. All commands consist of 
    a first line and a possible list of data sections separated by 
    newlines. The first line starts with a distinguishing keyword and 
    contains the length (in bytes including the final newline) of each 
    data section. All data is UTF-8 encoded. 

    In the following list 
    of commands, ``%d'' stands for a positive integer and %s for a string
    which contains no white space. ``\{cheated|not-cheated\}'' denotes
    the alternative of either ``cheated'' or ``not-cheated''. An
    integer following the keyword state is a state number. An integer
    following some xxx-bytes denotes the number of bytes of the next
    <data> section, including the final newline of that <data> section.
    A ``[ \ ]'' at the end of a line denotes line continuation without 
    newline.
    
    Prooftree understands the following commands in the following format:
    {ul

    {-  {v current-goals state %d current-sequent %s {cheated|not-cheated} \
       proof-name-bytes %d command-bytes %d sequent-text-bytes %d \
       additional-id-bytes %d\n\
       <data-proof-name>\n\
       <data-command>\n\
       <data-current-sequent>\n\
       <data-additional-ids>\n v}

       The [current-goals] command tells [prooftree] about a new proof 
       state with a new set of open goals. This corresponds to either of
       the following cases:
       {ul
         {- The initial proof state of a newly started proof}
         {- A proof command has been applied to the old current sequent, 
            yielding a new current sequent and possibly additional new 
            open subgoals}
         {- The old current goal has been solved (by some proof command) 
            and the new current sequent if one of the previously spawned 
            subgoals}
       }
    
       [prooftree] decides with the help of its internal state which of 
       the cases applies.
    
       The set of open goals does not need to represent the total 
       set of all open subgoals, but it must contain all newly 
       spawned subgoals.
    
       The state number in the [current-goals] command is for undo. 
       [current-sequent %s] denotes the ID of the current sequent. The 
       cheated flag tells [prooftree] whether the new proof state was 
       obtained by a cheating command such as [admit] or [sorry]. 
       The data sections are :
       {ol
    	 {- Full name of the proof}
    	 {- The proof command that yielded this proof state}
         {- Text of the current sequent}
         {- ID's of additionally open sequents (as space separated 
            list of strings)}
       }
    
       The second data section is ignored for initial proof states.

       The text of newly created additional goals other then the 
       current goal is expected to arrive separately with an 
       [update-sequent] command.
    }
    {- {v update-sequent state %d sequent %s proof-name-bytes %d \
       sequent-text-bytes %d\n\
       <data-proof-name>\n\
       <data-sequent>\n v}
    
       The update sequent command updates the text of some 
       known sequent. Such updates are necessary for newly spawned 
       subgoals. But also when existential variables get instantiated.
    
       The state number is for undo and the sequent ID denotes the 
       sequent to update. The data sections are:
       {ol
    	 {- Full name of the proof}
         {- new sequent text}
       }
    }
    {- {v switch-goal state %d sequent %s proof-name-bytes %d\n
       <data-proof-name>\n v}
    
       Switch goal tells [proftree] that the current goal has changed 
       without changing or solving the old current goal.
    
       The state number is for undo and the only data section is:
       {ol
    	 {- Full name of the proof}
       }
    }
    {- {v proof-complete state %d {cheated|not-cheated} \
       proof-name-bytes %d command-bytes %d\n\
       <data-proof-name>\n\
       <data-command>\n v}
    
       [proof-complete] tells [prooftree] the last proof command that 
       finished the current proof. The cheated flag tells [prooftree]
       whether the new proof state was obtained by a cheating command 
       such as [admit] or [sorry]. The data sections are :
       {ol
    	 {- Full name of the proof}
    	 {- The last proof command}
       }
    }
    {- {v undo-to state %d\n v}
    
       The state number here is not for undo, it is the undo-state.
       Undo tells [prooftree] to change the display to the state before 
       the first command with state [undo-state] has been processed.
    }
    {- {v quit-proof proof-name-bytes %d\n\
        <data-proof-name>\n v}
    
       Quit closed the window for the indicated proof.
       The only data section is:
       {ol
    	 {- Full name of the proof whoose window should be delected}
       }
    }
    }


    {2 General remarks}

    This module reads commands from a pipe. It may therefore happen
    that the input buffer depletes in the middle of a command. In this
    case we have to return control to the GTK main loop, which will
    call this module again, if the operating system decides that it is
    time to make more input available. The input channel is therefore
    turned into non-blocking mode, which means that reading raises an
    exception instead of blocking when currently no more input is
    available. As a consequence, the parsing engine in this module
    must be prepared to get interrupted whenever it tries to read from
    the input channel.

    The state of the parser is stored in three variables. The first
    one, {!Input.current_parser}, holds the function to be called when
    more input becomes available. It must always be set before new
    input is read from the input channel. Typically, there are
    partially filled buffers and index variables in the closure of
    [current_parser]. 

    The remaining two state variables are {!Input.command_buffer} and
    {!Input.command_buffer_index}. They hold the data when the parser
    is reading the first line of a command. In this case
    [current_parser] is set to {!Input.read_command_line}.

    Except for the first line of a command, the communication protocol
    is designed such that the parser always knows in advance how many
    bytes it must read. The first line of any command is terminated by
    a newline (of course) and holds all the size information for the
    remaining parts of the command.

    {!Input.current_parser} must be set to the parsing continuation function.
    This will be used in case parsing is interrupted now, because now more 
    input is currently available, and control is given back to the GTK main 
    loop. When more input becomes available the GTK main loop calls this

    parser. It reads input into {!Input.command_buffer} until it can
    extract the first line of a command. It then calls
    {!Input.parse_command} to finish parsing and process the command.

    way, this function is called again to parse the next command by
    the main parsing loop in {!Input.parse_input}.

    in an infinite loop until input depletes and parsing is
    interrupted. If parsing is interrupted this function calls
    {!Proof_tree.finish_drawing} to schedule a redisplay of the proof
    tree if necessary.

    All parsing functions raise [Sys_blocked_io] if no more input is
    available. This exception is caught here.
